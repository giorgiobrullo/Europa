## 🚀 About The Game

Europa is a 2D platform game with combat elements, developed as a Digital Games Development project. Set on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, the game features four distinct levels, each with unique environments and challenges.

Players control a heroic penguin with special abilities like double jump and combat moves. Throughout the game, the penguin can collect power-ups to help overcome increasingly difficult challenges. Beyond combat, the game includes challenging platforming sections with obstacles such as thwomps, rotating balls, and falling platforms.

## ✨ Features

- 🐧 Play as a heroic penguin with unique abilities

- ⚔️ Combat system with power-ups and special moves
- 🌍 Four unique levels with distinct themes

## 🎯 Game Mechanics Notes

- Falling platforms don't reset to their original position - this is intentional to add strategic challenge
- In the final level, falling platforms land on spikes but protect players from damage
- Players can't jump while on enemies (like slimes or bats) - they can only slide off
